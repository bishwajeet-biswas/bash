compare.sh script when executed will ask for the namespace and component name and will display its Image,
and to compare with another namespace it will ask again to input the namespace and component name.


images.sh script when executed will display you the component name and their respective images in a sequence. 
So if the same script is run for another namespace it will be easire to compare the images.
